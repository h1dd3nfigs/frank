				Frankbot v 0.1 2016/01/29 created by Ruth Fombrun<br/><br/>
				Frank is a publisher of fashion reviews that gathers its audience from social media and drives affiliate traffic to aliexpress.com. To support the rich textual content, we present photographs of real women wearing the apparel sold by AliExpress vendors. 
				<br/><br/>
				Frankbot is Frank's web crawling bot. Frankbot will not access the AliExpress website more than once every few seconds on average.

				Frank uses information from the AliExpress API to decide which products to feature and supply the title, pricing information and affiliate URLS.  	

				Frankbot will respect the directives in robots.txt, but some spammers do not.
